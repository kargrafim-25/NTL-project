Bollinger Bands show volatility expansion consistent with a breakout (price trading toward/above the upper band) and volume/momentum readings on recent candles indicate buyers are in control. Key intraday support sits near the 3,575–3,610 zone (stop placed below structural support) while immediate resistance / targets cluster in the 3,676–3,715 area — trade with managed risk.

Bollinger Bands are widening after a short squeeze which supports momentum continuation, and volume spiked on recent advances then cooled on pullbacks — a typical refresh before another leg higher.
